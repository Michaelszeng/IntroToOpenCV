# IntroToOpenCV

To run the final project, run identifying_rings.py, and use any of the 6 images of rings in the Ring Images directory.

Functions and Chapters used:
 - Chapter 3: Loading, Displaying
 - Chapter 4: Accessing and Manipulating Pixels
 - Chapter 6: Resizing, Cropping, Converting to HSV, Converting to Greyscale
 - Chapter 8: Gaussian Blur
 - Chapter 10: Canny Edge Detection
 - Chapter 11: Contours

This project is finished, although I will continue working on Hough Line Detection to rotate the image and improve accuracy in case the camera is tilted.
